This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Email Functionality Setup

The contact form uses Nodemailer to send emails. To set up the email functionality:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your-gmail-username@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
   ```

2. If using Gmail:
   - Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google account
   - Generate an "App Password" specifically for this application
   - Use that App Password instead of your regular password
   - More info: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833

3. Deploy with these environment variables set in your hosting platform (e.g., Vercel)
